-- =============================================
-- Mosaic ERP: Data Re-Import Migration
-- Run this BEFORE importing data from reimport_data.py
-- =============================================

-- Step 1: Add missing columns to inward_reinsurance
-- =============================================
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS agreement_number TEXT;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS borrower TEXT;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS retrocedent TEXT;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reference_link TEXT;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS city TEXT;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS exchange_rate NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sum_insured_fc NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sum_insured_uzs NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS premium_fc NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS premium_nc NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS gross_premium_uzs NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sum_reinsured_fc NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sum_reinsured_uzs NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS commission_nc NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tax_percent NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS net_premium_uzs NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS received_premium_currency TEXT;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS equivalent_usd NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS received_premium_uzs NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS number_of_slips INTEGER;

-- These may already exist from previous migration:
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS date_of_slip DATE;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS accounting_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reinsurance_inception_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reinsurance_expiry_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS premium_payment_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS actual_payment_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS insurance_days INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE inward_reinsurance ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reinsurance_days INTEGER;

-- Step 2: Truncate all data tables (order matters for FK constraints)
-- =============================================
TRUNCATE TABLE slips CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE inward_reinsurance CASCADE;

-- For policies, only delete Direct and OUTWARD records (preserve other types if any)
DELETE FROM policies WHERE "recordType" IN ('Direct', 'OUTWARD', 'Outward', 'Reinsurance');

-- Step 3: Drop and recreate views (they depend on the tables)
-- =============================================

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_direct_policies_consolidated;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_inward_consolidated;
